So essentially, this code sets the value of the $do variable to the value of the $_GET['do'] query parameter in the URL,
or to the string 'Manage' if the query parameter is not set.
This allows the code to determine which action to perform based on the value of the $_GET['do'] parameter.

$do = isset($_GET['do']) ? $_GET['do'] : 'Manage';
The isset() function checks if the $_GET['do'] variable is set (i.e., if it exists in the URL).
If $_GET['do'] is set, the ternary operator returns its value ($_GET['do']).
If $_GET['do'] is not set, the ternary operator returns the string 'Manage'.
The resulting value (either $_GET['do'] or 'Manage') is assigned to the $do variable.
